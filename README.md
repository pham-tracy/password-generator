# password-generator

## Description

This project was created to generate a random password through a series of prompts. Users are prompted to answer questions regarding what criteria they would like to include in their password. This includes password length and if they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. Once the user enters the information, this application generates a random password based on the their selected criteria.

This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS code was already provided so I developed JavaScript code to add function to this application.
